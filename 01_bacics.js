// Why learn React?
// - High demand in the job market.
// - Trending and widely adopted by tech companies.
// - Helps in building complex, scalable, and interactive UIs.
// - Makes it easier to manage frontend code as projects grow.
// - Encourages reusable components and cleaner structure.

// When should you learn React?
// - After mastering JavaScript fundamentals (ES6+, DOM, events, functions, arrays, objects).
// - React is not necessary in the early stage of small projects.
// - Use React when your UI has many parts updating frequently (helps manage complexity).

// Why was React created?
// - Facebook had a bug called the "Ghost Message" or "Phantom Notification" problem.
// - Users read all messages, but notification indicators still showed unread messages.
// - The issue was due to poor sync between JavaScript (state) and DOM (UI).
// - React was built to solve this by keeping the UI in sync with the state automatically.

// What is state in React?
// - "State" is just a fancy word for data/variables that can change over time.
// - If a variable affects what you see on the screen, it should be part of the state.
// - Example: number of items in a cart, user input, loading status, etc.

// What is the DOM?
// - DOM stands for Document Object Model: it represents the structure of a web page.
// - JavaScript can manipulate the DOM directly, but it becomes complex in large apps.
// - React uses a Virtual DOM to efficiently update only the necessary parts of the real DOM.

// Sync between state and UI:
// - React ensures that any change in state leads to a re-render of the UI.
// - This automatic sync prevents bugs like the ghost notification issue.

// 📘 Core Topics to Learn in React

// 1️⃣ Core of React
// - Understanding how React handles UI rendering.
// - Sync between state (JS) and UI (HTML via JSX).
// - JSX = JavaScript + HTML-like syntax used in React.

// 2️⃣ Component Reusability
// - React is component-based: build once, reuse anywhere.
// - Example: Button, InputField, Card, etc.

// 3️⃣ Reusing Components with Props
// - Props are inputs to a component (key-value pairs).
// - Helps pass data from parent to child components.
// - Example: <UserCard name="Naveen" age={23} />

// 4️⃣ Handling Changes with Hooks
// - Hooks are functions that let you use React features in functional components.
// - Most common: useState (for state), useEffect (for side effects).
// - Allows you to handle change, events, and lifecycle without classes.

// 🧩 Additional Add-ons to React

// 🔀 React Router (for navigation)
// - React by default doesn't support routing.
// - Use `react-router-dom` for client-side routing.
// - Enables multi-page navigation without full-page reloads.

// 📦 State Management Libraries
// - React has basic state with useState/useContext, but it’s limited for larger apps.
// - Popular state managers:
//   - Redux / Redux Toolkit
//   - Zustand
//   - Context API (for small to medium apps)

// 🏷️ Class-based Components
// - Older way of writing components using `class` keyword.
// - Still important to learn for understanding legacy codebases.
 
// ☁️ BaaS (Backend as a Service) Apps
// - Use Firebase, Supabase, or Appwrite for backend features like:
//   - Authentication
//   - Realtime Database
//   - File Storage

// 💡 Project Ideas to Practice React
// - Social Media Clone (Instagram, Twitter)
// - E-commerce App (with cart, filters, product list, checkout)
// - Blog Platform
// - Portfolio Website
// - To-Do or Notes App

// ✅ Installing Node.js
// - Node.js is a runtime that lets you run JavaScript outside the browser.
// - It comes with npm (Node Package Manager), which lets you install libraries/tools.

// ⚙️ npm vs npx
// - `npm` installs packages (libraries) locally or globally.
// - `npx` is used to execute packages directly without installing them permanently.

// 💡 Example:
// - `npx create-react-app` → runs the React app generator without saving it globally.

// 🚀 Create a React app (Traditional way)
// Step 1: npx create-react-app 01_basicsreact
// Step 2: cd 01_basicsreact
// Step 3: npm start  // Runs the app in development mode

// 📦 Inside create-react-app, you'll find a file: package.json
// package.json contains:
// - All the metadata about your project
// - Dependencies (libraries)
// - Scripts to automate tasks (start, build, test, etc.)

// 📜 Scripts inside package.json:
// - "start" → runs app in development mode (localhost:3000)
// - "build" → prepares app for production (optimized code)
// - Browser only understands HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
//   So React code (JSX) needs to be **transpiled and bundled** (converted) into browser-friendly code using Webpack (CRA default).

// 🧹 Linting
// - Linting shows syntax or formatting errors in your code.
// - Helps maintain code quality and avoid bugs.

// ⚡ Problem: create-react-app using `npx` is heavy and slow
// ➤ Solution: Use **Vite** – a faster, lightweight bundler

// ✨ Creating React App using Vite

// Step 1: npm create vite@latest
// - Vite will ask for your project name and template (choose React).
// Example:
// ? Project name: 01_vitereact
// ? Select a framework: React
// ? Select a variant: JavaScript or TypeScript

// Step 2: cd 01_vitereact

// Step 3: npm install (or just npm i)
// - This installs all required dependencies listed in package.json
// - After running this, a `node_modules/` folder is created
//   → It contains all the actual code of libraries (React, Vite, etc.)

// ❓ Why node_modules is missing before running `npm install`?
// - When you create the project, package.json is created with dependency list,
//   but nothing is downloaded yet.
// - Running `npm install` downloads and adds everything into node_modules.

// 🧹 Cleaning up default files:
// - You can delete unnecessary files like:
//   - `setupTests.js`
//   - `App.test.js`
//   - `logo.svg`
//   - `reportWebVitals.js`
//   - Anything else you're not using (to keep the codebase clean)

// 📝 Now, create your Hello World
// In `src/App.jsx` or `src/App.js`, write:
    // return <h1>Hello World</h1>;

// 🔁 Start the app
// - For create-react-app: npm start
// - For Vite app: npm run dev

// 📌 Summary:
// React App via CRA:
//   - Slower, uses Webpack
//   - `npx create-react-app`
//   - `npm start`
//
// React App via Vite:
//   - Fast, uses Vite bundler
//   - `npm create vite@latest`
//   - `npm install`
//   - `npm run dev`

// ❓ Question 1: Why is node_modules not created immediately when we create a Vite app?
// - When you run `npm create vite@latest`, it only scaffolds (creates) the project folder and files.
// - It sets up the project structure and a `package.json` file with the dependencies listed.
// - But it does NOT install those dependencies yet.
// - That’s why `node_modules/` folder is missing at this stage.

// ❓ Question 2: What dependencies are installed when we run `npm install` after creating a Vite-React app?
// - It installs the dependencies listed in `package.json`:
//     → "react" and "react-dom" (core libraries for building UI)
//     → "vite" and "@vitejs/plugin-react" (for fast development and JSX support)
// - These are downloaded into the `node_modules` folder, which is required for the app to run properly.

// 🔄 Connection between the two:
// - First, Vite sets up the project and lists the needed dependencies.
// - Then, `npm install` is used to actually download those dependencies into `node_modules`, making your project ready to run.
// 🧠 Important Difference:
// - create-react-app → installs everything automatically (includes node_modules)
// - vite → you must run `npm install` after project setup to get node_modules
